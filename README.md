I made a few changes:

- Use Step Events for keyboard handling
- Use Step Events for handling screen wrap for ship and asteroids (see: https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/wrap-outside-the-room-objects-disappear.8391)
- Add 'shift' function to slow ship down
- Variablize invincibility duration and gradually slow down flashing to give player better indication on when invincibility will end.
